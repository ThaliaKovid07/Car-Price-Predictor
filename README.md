# Car-Price-Predictor
 
OVERVIEW - 
This is a car price predictor based on the dataset from Kaggle. It takes various parameters from the users like the Number of Kilometers, No of previous owners, petrol of CNG or diesel, etc. and then tells them about the approximate price at which they can sell it.

Motivation -
The motivation of this project was to help people prevent themselves of any fraud or being duped by agents who make false promises and sell your car at a lower price just to get their commission. 

Technical Stack - 
HTMl is used as the frontend and Flask framework has been used as the backend.
The algorithm Random Tree Generator has been used for making the prediciton model because as a car has different number of attributes and features, random forest tree being a collected of random forests will help in considering all the features in a proper way.
